My name is Anna Weis, and I am a first-year master's student studying computer engineering. I work in the neuromorphic TENNLab researching and developing neural network architecture.
I would like to practice more machine learning techniques with generative models as that is an area in my research I am not as familiar with, and hopefully incorporate them into the final project.
I am open to the type and tools of software engineering techniques used for the project. My main goal with this class is to get more research experience and applicational practice with software engineering.
